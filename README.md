  1. display: flex 
  2. flex-direction: row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse 
  3. justify-content: flex-start, flex-end, space-between, space-around, space-evenly   
  4. align-items: flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline
  5. flex-wrap: nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse
  6. flex-shrink
  7. flex-grow
  8. flex-basis
  9. flex: grow shrink basis
  10. Order
